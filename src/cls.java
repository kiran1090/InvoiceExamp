 /* Create a class called Invoice that a hardware store might use to represent an invoice for
         an item sold at the store.
        An Invoice should include four pieces of information as instance variables‐a part number(type String),
         a part
        description(type String),a quantity of the item being purchased (type int) and a price per item  (double).
         Your
class should have a constructor that initializes the four instance variables. Provide a set and a get method for
        each instance variable. In addition, provide a method named getInvoice Amount that calculates the invoice
        amount (i.e., multiplies the quantity by the price per item), then returns the amount as a double value.
         If the
        quantity is not positive, it should be set to 0. If the price per item is not positive,
         it should be set to 0.0. Write a
        test application named InvoiceTest that demonstrates class Invoice’s capabilities.



 Write a Java application that allows the user to enter up to 20 integer grades into an array. Stop the loop by
        typing in ‐1. Your main method should call an Average method that returns the average of the grades.
         Use the
        DecimalFormat class to format the average to 2 decimal places */
